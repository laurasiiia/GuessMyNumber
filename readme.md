This was the first project I made from the Full Javascript course I'm currently taking! I made this a couple weeks ago, hope whoever is reading this finds it remotely cool for some reason :)

It's a guessing game, where you type in a number between 1-20 and keep trying until you guess the randomly selected number. It has a score and highscore system so you can keep track of how many tries you have made in the current play and the best score you achieved so far (with the least amount of guesses).

The HTML and CSS were not made by me. They were provided by the course teacher, as this course is only focused on the Javascript language. I hope someday to code the entire game by myself :)

I was incredible proud of myself when finishing it for being able to code myself before the teacher finished explaining everything. Also had so much fun! That's the most important part.

Oh, don't mind this line. Is just me discovering how to update the readme in git.
